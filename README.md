# Sentiment Analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN)

**Project Statement:** Creating a Sentiment Analysis Web App Using PyTorch and SageMaker

***Machine Learning Workflow***
- Download or otherwise retrieve the data.
- Process / Prepare the data.
- Upload the processed data to S3.
- Train a chosen model.
- Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).
- Deploy the trained model.
- Use the deployed model.

***Items Accomplished***
- Performed sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using recurrent neural networks(RNN)
- Implmented Long Term Short Memory (LTSM) model using PyTorch for the analysis
- Developed a deep learning model using PyTorch
